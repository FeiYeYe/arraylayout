If  you're curious, you can following this project's progress in
[my notebook|http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/patmorin/arraylayout/blob/master/src/arraylayouts.ipynb].

These tests are designed to be run on a Linux system.  First check that
you have at least 2GB of free memory by running free -h:

    > free -h
                 total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
    Mem:           15G       5.2G        10G        32M       498M       2.1G
    -/+ buffers/cache:       2.7G        12G
    Swap:          15G         0B        15G

The system above shows 10GB of free memory, so it's good to go.   
 
To run the tests, do

    make data

This will create a file called run_data.tgz that you can just email to me:

    morin@scs.carleton.ca

Note: Running these tests takes a while (15 minutes on a very fast system,
longer on slower systems) and it's preferable if you don't do much else
with your computer while they're running.  The tests are interruptible,
though. If you want your computer back, just hit Ctrl-C to stop them
and then run

     make data

again to pick up where you left off.

If you want to be extra helpful, you can also run:

    sudo dmidecode --type 17
or
    sudo dmidecode --type memory

and include the output in your email.  This will give me information
about the amount and type of memory installed in your computer, as
described here:

Thanks!
