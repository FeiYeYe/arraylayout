To run tests on a Linux system, do

    make data

This will create a file called run_data.tgz that you can just email to me:

    morin@scs.carleton.ca

If you want to be extra helpful, you can also run:

    sudo dmidecode --type 17
or
    sudo dmidecode --type memory

and include the output in your email.  This will give me information about
the amount and type of memory installed in your computer, as described here:

Thanks!
